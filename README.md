### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a cognitive scientist ðŸ¥¼ at [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) working on developing research software to make behavioral experiments easier, more accessible, and cheaper. I also occassionally study learning in classroom and laboratory contexts and build video games ðŸŽ® that incorporate cognitive science experiments into the gameplay. I teach classes on cognitive science, computational modeling, research methods, and robotics ðŸ¤–. 

I created and maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych), an open-source JavaScript tool for creating behavioral experiments that run in browsers. 

I'm currently working on building tools to enable new kinds of data collection with jsPsych (like eye tracking ðŸ‘€) and a tool for connecting web experiments to the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) so that data can be sent directly to the OSF when it is collected.
