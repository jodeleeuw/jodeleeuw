### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a cognitive scientist ðŸ¥¼ at [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) working on developing research software to make behavioral experiments easier, more accessible, and cheaper. I also occassionally study learning in classroom and laboratory contexts and build video games ðŸŽ® that incorporate cognitive science experiments into the gameplay. I teach classes on cognitive science, computational modeling, research methods, and robotics ðŸ¤–. 

I created and maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych), an open-source JavaScript tool for creating behavioral experiments that run in browsers. I recently built [DataPipe](https://pipe.jspsych.org), a tool for connecting web experiments to the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) so that data can be sent directly to the OSF when it is collected.

I'm currently working on building tools to enable new kinds of data collection with jsPsych (like eye tracking ðŸ‘€) and thinking about how to facilitate more collaborative development of experiments.
