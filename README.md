### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a cognitive scientist ðŸ¥¼ at [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) working on developing research software to make behavioral experiments easier, more accessible, and cheaper. My current interests are focused on how we can use deep learning to improve behavioral experiments, scientific workflows, and classroom experiences. I also occassionally study [learning in classroom](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459211027575) and laboratory contexts and build video games ðŸŽ® that incorporate cognitive science experiments into the gameplay. I teach classes on cognitive science, cognitive modeling, deep learning, research methods, and robotics ðŸ¤–. 

I created and maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych), an open-source JavaScript tool for creating behavioral experiments that run in browsers. I recently built [DataPipe](https://pipe.jspsych.org), a tool for connecting web experiments to the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) so that data can be sent directly to the OSF when it is collected.

I'm currently working on building a deep-learning based eye tracking system to enable high(er)-precision eye tracking ðŸ‘€ in online experiments. I'm also thinking about how to facilitate more [collaborative development of experiments](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-timelines) through open source ecosystems and creating [LLM-based tools](https://pat.vassar.edu) for structured conversations in classroom environments.

A complete list of my published work is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fUtClyAAAAAJ&hl=en).
